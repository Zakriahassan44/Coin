  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/Icons/
    - assets/Images/
    - assets/Images/coina.png
    - assets/Images/coinaaa.png
    - assets/Images/coinb.png
    - assets/animation/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
    - family: Montserrat-Italic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Italic.ttf
    - family: Montserrat-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
